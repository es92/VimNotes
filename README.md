# VimNotes

## Goals

Build the best note taking app for me

* Matches the featureset I've been using in icloud notes
* Works well on browsers
* Uses vim as the editor
* Saves history
* Encrypts files on the browser
* Works offline


## Install

1. Clone es-vim.js into root
2. Run a static webserver on root
3. Go to index.html

## Other

See /TODO for progress
